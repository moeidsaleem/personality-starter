      He had numerous relationships during his bachelor life.[2] He was then known as hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active on the London nightclub circuit.[2][212][213] He had numerous girlfriends during his bachelor life.[1] Many are unknown and were called 'mysterious blondes' by British newspaper The Times.[1] Some of his out of marriage relationships included relationship with Zeenat Aman,[214] Emma Sergeant, Susie Murray-Philipson, Sita White, Sarah Crawley,[1] Stephanie Beacham, Goldie Hawn, Kristiane Backer, Susannah Constantine, Marie Helvin, Caroline Kellett,[215] Jerry Hall and Lulu Blacker.[216][217]
<br>
      His first girlfriend, an artist, Emma Sergeant daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant is known to introduce him with society socialites.[1] They first met in 1982 and subsequently visited Pakistan.[218] She accompanied him on various Pakistani cricket team tours including in Peshawar and Australian tour.[218] His relationship with Sergeant was broken in 1986 after long separations between couple.[1] He then had short relationship with Susie Murray-Philipson whom he invited to Pakistan and had dinner with her back in 1982.[1] She also made various artistic portraits of Khan during their relation.[219][220]
      <br>
      In a book published in 2009, Christopher Sandford claimed that former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan had a close relationship when both were students in Oxford.[221] He wrote that Bhutto at the age of 21 first came close to Khan in 1975. They remained in relationship for about two months.[221] His mother also tried to have an arrange marriage between them.[221] He further claimed that they had sexual relationship too which was denounced by Khan saying we were only friends.[221]
     <br> 
      His most known relationship was with late heiress Sita White, daughter of late British industrialist Gordon White, Baron White of Hull.[2][3] They remained in the relationship for about six years having met in 1987-88.[222] According to Sita White, Khan agreed for a child in the 1991 meeting. Tyrian Jade was born on 15 June 1992 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center but Khan, according to White's allegation, refused to accept her because she was a girl.[222] Khan had urged White to go for an abortion [222] Tyrian looked extraordinarily like Khan.[3][223] Later in 1997, Los Angeles court announced the verdict which was put by his former partner Sita White and her lawyer Gloria Allred that Imran Khan is the father of a five year old girl named Tyrian-Jade White.[224] His former wife Reham Khan alleged Khan told her that Tyrian was not the only child fathered by him out of wedlock, there were four others, some of them had Indian mothers and the oldest of his children is 34 years old.[225][226][227] In a later interview, Reham conceded that she did not know where these children were, who they were and whether Khan was only boasting about it, and said that she "didn't even know if it is true also because you can never make out whether he tells the truth."[228] In 2004, after Sita's death, Khan agreed to accept Tyrian as his child and welcomed her to join their house.[229]
      <br>
      On 16 May 1995, at the age of 43, Khan married 21-year-old Jemima Goldsmith,[212] in a two-minute ceremony conducted in Urdu in Paris. A month later, on 21 June, they were married again in a civil ceremony at the Richmond registry office in England. Jemima converted to Islam. The couple have two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[230]
    <br>  
      Rumours circulated that the couple's marriage was in crisis. Goldsmith denied the rumours by publishing an advertisement in Pakistani newspapers.[231] On 22 June 2004, it was announced that the couple had divorced, ending the nine-year marriage because it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan".[232][233]
    <br>  
      In January 2015, it was announced that Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his residence in Islamabad.[234][235] However, Reham Khan later states in her autobiography that they in fact got married in October 2014 but the announcement only came in January the year after. On 22 October, they announced their intention to file for divorce.[236]
      <br>
      In mid-2016, late 2017 and early 2018, reports emerged that Khan had married his spiritual mentor (murshid), Bushra Maneka. Khan,[237][238] PTI aides[239][240] and members of the Manika family[241][242] denied the rumour. Khan termed the media "unethical" for spreading the rumour,[243] and PTI filed a complaint against the news channels that had aired it.[244] On 7 January 2018, however, the PTI central secretariat issued a statement that said Khan had proposed to Manika, but she had not yet accepted his proposal.[245] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan has married Manika.[246][247] According to Khan, his life has been influenced by Sufism for three decades, and this is what drew him closer to his wife.[248]
